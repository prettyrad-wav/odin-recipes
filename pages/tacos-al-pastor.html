    <img src="../img/tacos.jpg" alt="Tacos al pastor" width="800">
    <p>Writings from 16th Century Mexico City document the Spanish conquistadors, led by Hernando Cortes, treating European captains to a taco feast. Now beloved across the world, tacos are perhaps the most famous Mexican street food. "Tacos al pastor is a quintessential Mexican dish with tender pork and pineapple marinated in a savory and aromatic chile sauce," says docmancito, who suggests serving in warm corn tortillas with tomatillo salsa.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1 tablespoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Direction</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook tomato on a ridged grill pan over medium-high heat until slightly blackened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool until easily handled. Peel off skin and remove seeds.</li>

        <li>Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add guajillo and ancho chile peppers; cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
        
        <li>Combine tomato flesh, softened chile peppers, 2 slices pineapple, orange juice, quartered onion, vinegar, chipotle peppers, salt, garlic, cloves, cumin seeds, and oregano in a blender; blend until smooth.</li>
        
        <li>Arrange pork slices in a glass or ceramic baking dish. Pour blended mixture over pork, ensuring all sides are evenly coated. Cover baking dish with plastic wrap.</li>
        
        <li>Marinate pork in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.</li>
        
        <li>Cook remaining pineapple slices on a ridged grill pan over medium-high heat until slightly blackened and soft, about 5 minutes per side. Chop into small pieces.</li>
        
        <li>Wipe out grill pan and preheat over medium-high heat. Cook marinated pork in the hot pan, turning once, until browned, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
