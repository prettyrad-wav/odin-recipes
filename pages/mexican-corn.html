    <p>A staple of Mayan cuisine, corn has been enjoyed for centuries. But across Mexico these days, the choice corn is known as elote, which is grilled or boiled corn on the cob smothered in butter, mayonnaise, cotija cheese, and lime juice. Some eloteros, or people selling elote from carts, also throw salt and spices for an added kick!</p>
