    <h1>Churro's</h1>
    <img src="../img/churros.jpg" alt="churros" width="800">
    <p>The conquistadors introduced this traditional Spanish and Portuguese fried pastry to Latin America. Coated in cinnamon-sugar and traditionally served with chocolate for dipping, Mexican street-style churros are also often filled with dulce de leche, chocolate, or other sweet fillings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 qt oil for frying</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        
        <li>Combine water, 2 ½ tablespoons sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a small saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil and remove from the heat.</li>
        
        <li>Stir in flour, stirring until mixture forms a ball.</li>
        
        <li>Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Transfer dough to a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip.
        </li>
        
        <li>Carefully pipe a few 5- to 6-inch strips of dough into the hot oil; work in batches so you don't crowd the fryer.
        </li>
        
        <li>Cook until golden; use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer churros to paper towels to drain.</li>
        
        <li>Combine 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll drained churros in cinnamon and sugar mixture. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
